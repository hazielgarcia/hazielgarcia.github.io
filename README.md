### Projects
Azlheimer's Disease Detection
- Collaborated in a team of five to analyze and harmonize data from the Wisconsin
Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention (WRAP) to assess the feasibility of predicting
amyloid-b plaque positivity, a key indicator of Alzheimer’s disease
- Conducted comprehensive data cleaning, alignment and, exploratory analysis on five
datasets for 1,729 WRAP participants, ensuring high-quality data for model development
- Achieved 93.9% prediction accuracy of amyloid-β plaque positivity using logistic
regression models built in R and developed a reduced model prioritizing cost-effective
predictors with comparable performance (93.7% accuracy)
- Implemented Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) to address imbalanced
categorical distributions, ensuring robust model evaluation across all data points.
- Calculated Log Loss values for all predictor combinations, identifying the optimal set
with the lowest Log Loss (0.157) as the best predictor of amyloid-β plaque positivity
